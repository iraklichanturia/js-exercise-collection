// Rotate Array: Write a program that rotates the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of positions. Use splice() to achieve the rotation.

// Split an Array: Implement a function that splits an array into two separate arrays at a given index. Use splice() to divide the array.

// Chunk Array: Write a program that chunks an array into subarrays of a specified size. The original array should be modified using the splice() method.

// Remove All Occurrences of a Value: Create a function that removes all occurrences of a specific value from an array using the splice() method.

// Reorder Array by Index: Given an array of items and an array of indices, reorder the items in the original array according to the index array using the splice() method.

// Split Array at Odd Values: Write a program that splits an array into two arrays: one containing all the odd values and the other containing all the even values. Use splice() to accomplish this.

// Flatten Nested Arrays: Implement a function that flattens a nested array into a single flat array. Use splice() to modify the original array.

// Remove Negatives and Add Them to the End: Write a program that removes all negative values from an array and appends them to the end of the array using the splice() method.
